# Optimization-of-Signals
Inter-Process Communication which links output generated by C++ with optimizing graph problem executed in Python and counts shortest path between them.

-- ece650-a1.py is a python file which takes arguments as a string having coordinates in a specific format and return (graph) number of vertices and edges between them.

-- ece650-a2.cpp is a c++ file which takes arguments - Number of vertices and edges between them, two vertices that to find shortest path between them and return
the result (i.e shortest path between the mentioned two vertices).

-- ece650-a3.cpp is a c++ file which makes use of IPC (inter-process communication) between the two above files i.e graph generated from ece650-a1.py and gives
this input to ece650-a2.cpp and giving two vertices to calculate shortest path between them. The inputs of this file is not given directly but instead generated
manually with the help of rgen.cpp and the input (two vertices namely source and destination) is given manually after the program has generated graph.

-- rgen.cpp is a c++ file which randomly generates valid input for ece650-a1.py through command line.

-- For execution - run the file rgen.cpp
